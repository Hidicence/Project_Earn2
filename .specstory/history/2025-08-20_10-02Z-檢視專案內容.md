<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Preparing for inspections**

I see the user prefers me to work in small, manageable batches. They also want to make sure to do a git backup or commit before any code changes. However, right now, the user has asked me to inspect without modifying the code. My plan is to provide findings and suggestions based on this first batch of inspections. I'll move forward with that approach!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Scanning JS files**

The spec indicates that I need to provide a micro-update about recent actions and next steps, which is good! In this turn, I’ll continue scanning the remaining JS files. I’m planning to run parallel reads for js/auth.js, js/charts.js, js/data.js, js/tableUI.js, and js/ui.js using multi_tool_use.parallel for efficiency.

Once that’s done, I’ll summarize the audit, covering aspects like architecture, data models, features, and potential issues such as missing Bootstrap and Google OAuth comments. I also need to clarify some configurations related to Vercel.
**Checking for missing files**

I need to check for any missing files mentioned in the README. I see that ui.js is listed, but index only references auth.js, data.js, tableUI.js, charts.js, and app.js. I notice that ui.js isn’t included in index, so it might be unused. I’ll read through it to confirm. 

I also need to check if index.html includes Chart.js, while charts.js might be handling that. Additionally, tableUI.js and data.js manage table rendering and localStorage. Running parallel reads will help me gather this information quickly. I'll also look at line counts to pinpoint some code, then suggest improvements, including missing Google OAuth integration and DOM element checks.</details></think>

我先把其餘 JS 檔案一次讀完，完整了解資料流與 UI 邏輯，方便給出準確建議與後續改進方向。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Identifying potential issues**

I’m realizing there’s a problem with how the charts are mounted. Since they aren’t, that’s not a major issue. However, `app.js` pulls data from `data.js`, which may not align with what the user has. The devTools check the user ID, so if no data is stored, counts will be zero, making it not very useful.

I suspect there’s a bug in `tableUI.selectMonth`. It uses `event.currentTarget` but isn’t passing the event to `selectMonth(month)`. I need to address that! It should accept an event argument to avoid breaking the toggling of the 'active' class.
**Addressing function conflicts**

I’m noticing that strict mode isn’t standard for all browsers, and window.event can exist in Internet Explorer but isn’t standard today. So, that needs a fix.

There are also two functions named `startLocalMode`: one in `auth.js` and another in `tableUI`. Since `auth.js` loads first, the `tableUI` function overwrites it. The click handler in `auth.js` calls `startLocalMode()`, which will reference whichever function is in scope. Although they do similar tasks, using duplicated names is confusing. The `auth.js` version sets the current user and local mode, while the `tableUI` version toggles the local mode flag and initializes it.
**Highlighting project inconsistencies**

There’s a duplicate issue I noticed, but it’s not critical. The CSS has modern styling, which is fine. 

I see there's a `GOOGLE_OAUTH_SETUP.md` file that hasn't been read yet, and the `index.html` disables the Google GSI script due to the file protocol. The `vercel.json` configuration is set up correctly for a static site.

However, I'm missing the `index.html` code for charts, which might be simplified in the workspace. The README still references Bootstrap 5, which is inconsistent since the project isn’t using it. 

There’s also an issue in `tableUI.updateStatistics`, as it calculates the average ratio without subtracting monthly company expenses, which might be what’s needed. 

Finally, the assistant wants to check the project and will report the findings. They prefer responses in Chinese, without emojis, in small batches, confirming each step before proceeding. However, no code changes are being made just yet.
**Proposing project improvements**

I think we can unify the data model to resolve duplication and decide whether to remove `ui.js` and charts, or create a charts section. Since the assistant needs to check with the user before refactoring, I’ll ask clarifying questions and suggest small next steps.

I’ll outline key concerns and suggestions with minimal verbosity. Possible quick fixes include repairing the `selectMonth` bug, unifying `currentMonth` using `window.currentMonth`, renaming one `startLocalMode`, and addressing the charts HTML references. 

They asked, "請你檢視一下這個專案," so I’ll deliver a concise audit focusing on key issues and suggested next steps, potentially listing optional code changes without including code unless requested.
**Preparing code citations**

I need to avoid using emojis, which also means I don’t need to mention citing that memory, even if "不使用表情符號" is noted. The requirement indicates we only need citations when using memory to reply or run commands.

I should include citations for things like "git backup before changes" and "small batches." I'll ensure to show minimal code line citations and reference the CSS errors.

For the `::root` line, I’ll prepare a snippet from `css/styles.css`, specifically lines 13 to 21:

```13:21:css/styles.css
::root {
    /* 現代化色彩系統 - 受 Once UI 啟發 */
    --brand-primary: #6366f1;
    ...
}
```

Next, for the `selectMonth` function in `js/tableUI.js`, I’ll share lines 121 to 136:

```121:136:js/tableUI.js
function selectMonth(month) {
    currentMonth = month;
    // 更新標籤狀態
    document.querySelectorAll('.month-tab').forEach(tab => {
        tab.classList.remove('active');
    });
    event.currentTarget.classList.add('active');
    ...
}
```

I also want to show the duplicate `startLocalMode` definitions in both `auth.js` at lines 110 to 118 and `tableUI.js` at lines 48 to 62. My goal will be to keep everything concise. Finally, I’ll provide a short summary at the end to wrap it up neatly.</details></think>

---

我已讀過主要檔案（`index.html`、`css/styles.css`、`js/*.js`、`README.md`、`vercel.json`），先給你精準盤點與建議。

### 專案概況
- 前端純靜態，使用自訂 CSS 與 Font Awesome；未使用 Bootstrap。
- 認證採 Google OAuth，但本地預設使用本地模式。
- 資料層有兩套邏輯並存：`data.js`（以使用者ID隔離、含專案/支出集合）與 `tableUI.js`（以月份為 key 的 `localStorage` 簡化模型）。
- 圖表程式在 `charts.js`，但頁面沒有對應的 `<canvas>`，因此目前圖表不會顯示。

### 立即可修復的錯誤與風險
- CSS 變數未生效：`styles.css` 把 `:root` 寫成了 `::root`，導致所有 `var(--...)` 失效。
```13:21:css/styles.css
::root {
    /* 現代化色彩系統 - 受 Once UI 啟發 */
    --brand-primary: #6366f1;
    ...
}
```
- 月份切換 bug：`selectMonth` 依賴隱式全域 `event`，在現代瀏覽器不保證可用。
```121:136:js/tableUI.js
function selectMonth(month) {
    currentMonth = month;
    // 更新標籤狀態
    document.querySelectorAll('.month-tab').forEach(tab => {
        tab.classList.remove('active');
    });
    event.currentTarget.classList.add('active'); // ← 依賴隱式 event
    ...
}
```
- 全域變數衝突：`currentMonth`、`currentTab` 在多檔案重複定義（`app.js`、`tableUI.js`、`ui.js`、`charts.js`），型別與掛載方式不同（`window.currentMonth` vs 頂層 `let`），可能造成不可預期行為。
- 重複函式名稱：`startLocalMode` 在 `auth.js` 與 `tableUI.js` 各自定義，後載入者會覆蓋前者。
```110:118:js/auth.js
function startLocalMode() { ... }
```
```48:62:js/tableUI.js
function startLocalMode() { ... }
```
- 圖表無法出現：`charts.js` 依賴 `projectComparisonChart`、`expenseDistributionChart` 的 `<canvas>`，但 `index.html` 未提供對應 DOM；也沒有地方會呼叫 `loadCharts()`。
- README 與實作不一致：README 標註 Bootstrap 5 與多分頁導覽，但頁面與程式現況採自訂樣式與單頁表格；`ui.js` 屬於舊結構，且未在 `index.html` 引用。

### 架構重點問題
- 資料層分裂：`data.js` 與 `tableUI.js` 使用不同的資料模型與儲存 key，彼此無法互通。`app.js` 的 devTools 與 `charts.js` 依賴 `data.js`，但實際 UI 操作寫入的是 `tableUI.js` 的 key，造成圖表/統計與資料導出難以一致。
- 死碼與過時碼：`ui.js`（Bootstrap 多分頁）、`charts.js`（未掛 DOM/未呼叫）目前屬於未使用狀態。

### 建議決策
- 建議先決定單一資料來源：
  - A. 保留 `tableUI.js` 的月度模型（最少變更）：移除 `data.js` 與依賴它的程式（或日後再重構接軌）。
  - B. 全面改為使用 `data.js` 的結構（更規範）：調整 `tableUI.js` 的存取，統一透過 `data.js` 讀寫，再補齊圖表與導出。
- 決定是否要保留圖表功能：
  - 若要保留：在 `index.html` 加入對應 `<canvas>` 容器與切換邏輯，並整合資料來源。
  - 若暫不需要：先移除 `charts.js` 與 Chart.js 載入，避免負擔與混淆。

### 我建議的第一波小批次修正
- 修正 `:root` 與 `selectMonth`（低風險、高影響）。
- 合併重複的 `startLocalMode`，統一由 `auth.js` 觸發並在內部呼叫 `initializeAppAfterLogin`。
- 統一 `currentMonth` 的來源為 `window.currentMonth`，並修改引用處。

若你同意，我會先建立 Git 備份再做上述小批量修改，改完再停下來給你確認[[memory:1011857]][[memory:1011878]]。請選擇：
- 僅進行第一波小修（`:root`、`selectMonth`、`startLocalMode` 合併、`currentMonth` 統一）
- 同時決定資料層走 A（保留 `tableUI`）或 B（改用 `data.js`）
- 是否要保留並補齊圖表區塊

- 我已完成對專案的全面檢視，找出 CSS 根本錯誤、月份切換 bug、全域變數與函式衝突、資料層分裂，以及圖表未掛載等關鍵問題。建議先以小批次修正穩定頁面，再決定資料層與圖表策略。

我先說  這份資料與表格最後是要串接到GOOGLE Sheet中的  所以擬修改的時候邏輯一定要正確  到時候再能無痛輸出到試算表中
然後其他的可以依照你的想法修改  只要不要動到UIUX就好

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating data model for Google Sheets**

I'm planning minimal edits that won't disrupt the UI/UX while preparing for Google Sheets integration. Right now, there's inconsistency in the way data is organized, with `tableUI.js` using specific project keys and `data.js` utilizing a richer structure for monthly stats and chart data. To map effectively to Google Sheets, I think we should standardize entity collections from `data.js`, which offers categories and projects suited for separate tabs. I could adapt `tableUI.js` to ensure it writes to the `data.js` model in the background without altering the UI.
**Implementing adapter layer in tableUI.js**

I plan to implement a small "adapter layer" in `tableUI.js` to call functions from `data.js` instead of using localStorage. This change won't affect the UI markup. I'll adjust functions like `loadProjects`, `saveProjects`, and those for monthly expenses to map expense types into categories. Since "expenseTypes" are table column names, I'm thinking we can derive them from dynamic categories and map them accordingly. I'll also ensure that `data.js` aligns with how projects and expenses are managed, taking care to include properties like `totalRevenue`.
**Extending payment management for Google Sheets**

I realize there's no current model for payment receipts, so for Google Sheets integration, I think we need to track payments per project. Instead of complicating things, I’ll enhance `data.js` to include an optional payment field in the project object, using `updateProject`. For rendering, I'll adapt table functions: `loadProjects()` will pull projects via `getProjects(month)`, and when editing values, `updateProjectExpense` should convert the expense type to a category ID and update accordingly. I'll ensure project income updates with `updateProject` for total revenue, but note that the current design references projects by index from local storage.
**Modifying internal project management**

I'm considering maintaining an internal projects array loaded from `data.js` using `getProjects(currentMonth)`. This returns detailed project objects with essential info. I’ll adjust `createProjectRow` to calculate totals by calling `getProjectExpenses(project.id)` and creating an "expense map." This way, it separates the UI from the storage format. For events, instead of using `projectIndex`, I can pass `projectId`, but I need to update the HTML markup accordingly. For the first batch of changes, I’ll focus on addressing a CSS bug and modifying `selectMonth` to improve event handling.
**Refactoring tableUI and setting up backup**

I'm looking at removing the binding for the button in `tableUI` by eliminating a specific block of code. This means I’ll adjust how `apply_patch` functions without conflicts with window exports. Specifically, I want to rename `window.startLocalMode` to `window.startLocalModeUI` to avoid overriding issues. I’ll remove related functions and bindings for the 'useLocalOnlyBtn' completely, since they're not referenced elsewhere. 

Next, I'll ensure the workspace is set up for a backup with Git, creating a new branch for these changes before I proceed with the edits. I'll prepare some patches for the CSS and JavaScript files, focusing on cleaning up specific lines. After everything is edited, I'll commit the changes.</details></think>

我先建立 Git 備份分支，然後進行小批次修正（修正 CSS :root、修正月份切換事件、統一 currentMonth、移除本地模式重複綁定與函式），不改 UI。接著我會把變更提交到該分支。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing variable scope**

I’m diving into how variables interact in JavaScript. It seems like the top-level `let currentMonth` in `tableUI.js` creates a function-scoped variable that's not a property of `window`. So, `charts.js` referencing it might cause confusion since it captures the global environment. There's a distinction between the `let` binding and `window.currentMonth`, leading to two variables in play! To avoid inconsistency, I think I should just use `window.currentMonth` everywhere instead of having that `let` in `tableUI.js`.
**Updating variable references**

I’m thinking about how to handle `currentMonth` in `tableUI.js`. I could replace it with `window.currentMonth` or create a reference function, but the simplest solution is just to remove the `let` declaration. For `currentTab`, it looks like `tableUI.js` doesn’t use it much, except in `updateCharts`, and since there's no UI for it, I might as well leave it alone for now. 

So, my steps will include updating CSS and modifying the JavaScript code to eliminate the unnecessary `let` declaration.
**Refining function assignments**

I'm figuring out how to replace reads and writes for `currentMonth` with a new function signature for `selectMonth`, allowing it to accept parameters. I'll adjust it to include `month` and `tabElement`. This will enable me to set `window.currentMonth` directly. 

I also plan to remove the duplicate `startLocalMode` in `tableUI.js`, since `initializeAppAfterLogin` seems to handle everything necessary. The "local mode" UI assets can be simplified, as the current logic with `auth.js` appears to be sufficient. The slight text change won't affect UI/UX negatively.
**Assessing UI changes**

I'm considering whether changing the displayed text counts as a UI modification. Right now, the header shows `userEmail` as 'local@localhost' when using `auth.js`, but `initializeLocalMode` sets it to '離線模式'. I'm cautious about changing anything since it was advised not to alter UI/UX. 

To keep the '離線模式' without having duplicate `startLocalMode`, I could adjust `showSignedInState` in `auth.js` to set the `userEmail` to '離線模式' when in local mode. That way, I avoid any unintended UI changes while preserving the intended behavior.
**Planning code updates**

I’m thinking about wrapping the `startLocalMode` function in a conditional check to keep things tidy. For simplicity, I could just remove its export line instead. Next, I'll update references to `updateProject` and adjust `charts.js` to use `window.currentMonth` and `window.currentTab`. 

In `auth.js`, I want to change the `currentUser` email to '離線模式' and set the user details accordingly. Preserving the original indentation style is crucial, so I’ll check if the files use tabs or spaces before applying any changes. Lastly, I’ll create a patch for the necessary modifications!</details></think>

---

我要先進行一小批次的程式修正，不動 UI：修正 CSS 變數生效、修正月份切換的事件傳遞、統一使用 window.currentMonth、移除重複的本地模式函式並保留原有「離線模式」顯示。接著會提交這些變更。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Examining patch application**

I tried to apply a patch, but it didn't work because the context didn't match—probably due to whitespace issues or something similar. To solve this, I should re-open the file to check the location and ensure the exact context is correct. Earlier, I read css/styles.css and noted "::root {" at line 13. Since the apply_patch requires an exact match, I need to revisit that small portion around it for clarity.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Trying patch application**

I'm thinking about whether to add a blank line for pre-context. It seems a bit tricky. I'll try this format: 

```
*** Begin Patch
*** Update File: css/styles.css
@@
-::root {
+:root {
*** End Patch
```

If it doesn't work again, I might have to fall back to the edit_file tool. For now, I’ll focus on applying this patch with minimal context and see what happens!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Editing code for month selection**

I need to make some edits to the code now. The function `selectMonth` needs to accept an event parameter. I'll modify `initializeMonthTabs` to set this event argument on click. For example, I can attach an event handler with something like `function(e) { selectMonth(monthValue, e.currentTarget); }`. There’s also the option to pass the tab element directly when calling `selectMonth`. I think passing the element as a second parameter might simplify things, so I’ll adjust the function signature accordingly.
**Implementing month selection updates**

I’m planning some changes in `js/tableUI.js`. First, I’ll redefine `selectMonth` to take `month` and `tabElement` as parameters. I want to update the active month by removing the 'active' class from all tabs and adding it to the specified tab element if provided. If not, I’ll set the active status based on matching content.

Next, I’ll update the `initializeMonthTabs` with a click event to call `selectMonth`. Lastly, I need to unifying `currentMonth` to reference `window.currentMonth` instead of redeclaring it in `tableUI`.  This will help avoid conflicts and maintain clarity in the code.
**Updating currentMonth references**

I’m realizing there are quite a few instances of `currentMonth` that need updates. The key thing is to set `currentMonth` to `window.currentMonth`, especially since various functions like `saveProjects` rely on this. 

In `tableUI.js`, I’ll change the initialization: instead of `let currentMonth`, I’ll check if `window.currentMonth` exists and set it if it doesn’t. I also need to update functions using `currentMonth`, such as `initializeMonthTabs` and `loadProjects`, to refer to `window.currentMonth`. 

Additionally, there's duplication with `startLocalMode` in both `auth.js` and `tableUI.js`. Renaming or consolidating those will help streamline things!
**Resolving startLocalMode conflicts**

I noticed a conflict with the `startLocalMode` function in both `auth.js` and `tableUI.js`. `auth.js` sets `currentUser` and calls `showSignedInState`, which can lead to issues if both functions run. 

To avoid conflicts, I should keep `auth.js` as the primary source and remove the duplicate in `tableUI`. Instead, I'll create a wrapper in `tableUI` that calls `window.startLocalMode` from `auth.js`, or fall back to `initializeLocalMode`.

I might rename the one in `tableUI` to `startLocalModeUI` and update references to prevent overshadowing the global export. That way, `tableUI` remains in sync with `auth.js` without conflicts.
**Implementing file edits and adjustments**

I’m planning to make several edits now. First, I’ll remove or rename the `startLocalMode` function in `tableUI.js`, keeping `initializeLocalMode`. I'll update the setup to call `window.startLocalMode` from `auth.js`, ensuring it won’t conflict at runtime.

Next, in the event listeners, I'll change calls to `startLocalMode` and adapt the export mappings to avoid overrides. Regarding `exportData`, I'll be cautious about name conflicts, but keep it flexible for future integrations. 

Lastly, I'll adjust occurrences of `currentMonth` to reference `window.currentMonth` throughout, ensuring everything remains consistent. Then, I’ll implement these changes carefully by applying a patch!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Confirming user preferences**

I need to check in for confirmation about our next steps. The user prefers direct shell commands, and it seems we've already done some commands. Additionally, I'll remember to respond in Chinese as that's their preference. I should avoid using emojis too. So, I’ll present the planned changes, specifically moving to Step 2, which involves unifying the data layer, and ask for confirmation to proceed with that step. Let’s keep it clear and concise!
**Planning data structure changes**

I need to introduce a canonical store in `data.js` and modify `tableUI.js` to use this new data structure for projects and monthly expenses. It’s important to migrate existing localStorage keys to fit this new structure and de-duplicate the `startLocalMode` function. I also want to implement an export function that serializes data to fit a Google Sheets layout, including multiple sheets like ‘Projects’ and ‘ProjectExpenses.’ 

Currently, `tableUI` stores expenses differently, so I must consider normalizing this for better export functionality.
**Considering model changes**

Switching to a normalized model would indeed require a significant refactor of `tableUI`. However, since `data.js` already supports this structure, aligning `tableUI` with it can streamline our data handling. I need to modify the code to read and update through the `addProjectExpense` function, which needs `categoryId`. 

While the UI currently uses columns for each expense type, I can map these inputs to line items by updating them per project. But given the "small batch" approach, I think it might be more practical to implement an export adapter first. This way, I can transform existing data from `tableUI` into JSON without altering the current UI.
**Planning data storage unification**

The user emphasized that logic must be correct for smooth output to spreadsheets. This indicates I should define and lock down the canonical data schema and implement the necessary exporter functions now, even if our internal storage remains unchanged for the moment. 

Later, when connecting to the Google Sheets API, we'll map these exporters. I propose adding a `sheetsAdapter.js` or implementing an `exportForSheets()` function that provides a normalized payload, including sheets arrays or even CSV. This can be done without altering the UI, adding a new export button labeled "匯出數據" that works with multi-sheet exports instead.</details></think>

我已先做小批次修正並完成備份分支（chore/sheets-prep-step1）[[memory:1011857]][[memory:1011878]]:
- 修正 `css/styles.css` 中 `:root` 變數未生效問題（原本寫成 `::root`）
- 修正月份切換不可靠的隱式 `event`，改為顯式傳入點擊元素
- 統一使用 `window.currentMonth`，避免跨檔案全域變數衝突
- 移除 `startLocalMode` 重複定義衝突，統一由 `auth.js` 負責並回呼初始化

接下來為了將來無痛串接 Google 試算表，我建議先確立「標準資料結構」並新增匯出轉接層（不動 UI/UX）：

- Projects: id, month, name, totalIncome, payment, createdAt
- ProjectExpenses: id, projectId, month, categoryName, amount, note, createdAt
- CompanyExpenses: id, month, category, amount, description, createdAt
- ExpenseCategories: id, name, description

做法（不改畫面與操作邏輯）：
- 新增一個匯出模組，從目前 localStorage 資料（含 `tableUI.js` 的月度結構）轉成上述四個表的「標準列資料」，提供 `window.exportForGoogleSheets()` 回傳 JSON（之後可直接對接 Google Sheets API 或轉 CSV）。
- 現階段不動現有按鈕行為，只先提供可從 Console 觸發的匯出函式；等你準備對接時，再接上 API 即可。

要不要我現在進行「新增匯出轉接層（exportForGoogleSheets）」這一步？我會先建 Git 備份分支，再實作，不改 UI。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Identifying form data issues**

I noticed that the submitNewProject function uses FormData to gather input from the 'projectForm'. However, the input with ID 'projectName' lacks a name attribute, which is what FormData.get relies on. This means formData.get('projectName') returns null, leading to an error when calling .trim. To fix this, I should add name attributes in the index.html for the input fields such as 'projectName', 'projectIncome', and 'projectPayment'. Since the user asked to avoid changing the UI/UX, this won't affect the visual layout. 

Also, there's an issue with submitting data if the modal stays open after clicking "add" again.
**Analyzing project submission issues**

In the submitNewProject function, the modal hides and resets the form after a successful submission, which seems fine. However, the "click again" issue is likely due to the previous error rather than multiple event listeners. They also mentioned needing to display existing expense types when adding new ones and wanting a modal for that, which may introduce new behavior not originally planned due to UI constraints. I can implement a modal that fits the current style. Short-term, their reference to fixing a TypeError in app.js and providing solutions is clear; I'll focus on addressing those specific errors right away.
**Fixing FormData and error logging**

First, I want to address the issue with FormData returning null. I also need to look into the error logging in app.js. We could prevent logging null messages, but the user might prefer stopping global error logs entirely. I can change console.error to log e.message or e.filename:line if available. 

It's likely the error on "app.js:40" stems from an unhandled promise rejection, so I can wrap the console call to ensure I log only meaningful messages. Lastly, the showToast function in app.js needs adjustment since it incorrectly uses a second parameter for an error message that the tableUI.js version doesn't support. I'll correct that to ensure it's functional.
**Clarifying error handling and month functions**

I need to ensure the showToast function is available when it's called in app.js, and since app.js runs last, it should be defined. To improve error logging, I’ll modify the error handler to safely log messages and avoid "null" entries. I'll implement this by checking for valid error messages and showing a toast notification when errors occur.

Next, I need to focus on the selectMonth function, which references deleteMonth, but that function isn't defined yet. The user mentioned having issues with "新增月份" not responding and needing functionality to delete existing months. I'll prioritize addressing those two specific errors right away.
**Addressing errors and planning next steps**

The user previously asked to fix multiple errors, and after resolving them, I need to implement month add/delete functionality and expense type management. For now, I’ll focus on correcting the issues they're facing with app.js and tableUI.js.

First, I’ll update index.html by adding name attributes to the relevant input fields: changing 'projectName', 'projectIncome', and 'projectPayment' to include name attributes. I’ll also ensure app.js error logging is adjusted, keeping the indentation style consistent. Once these changes are made, I'll prepare for committing the code.</details></think>

我會先修正兩個報錯來源：1) 在 `index.html` 的專案表單加上正確的 name 屬性以修復 `tableUI.js` 中的 `FormData.get(...).trim()` 為 null 的問題；2) 在 `app.js` 的全域錯誤處理器中，避免列印 `null`，改為安全地取用錯誤訊息並顯示。接著我會提交這批修正。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Assessing UI Changes**

I’m considering the implementation of `addExpenseType()`, which currently just prompts for input and stores in localStorage. The user wants a listing for categories, but also insists on not changing the UI/UX, which feels contradictory. However, there might be a way to create a simple modal that blends with the existing style without breaking consistency. Although adding a modal might still count as a UI change, I could also implement a basic alert for category listing as a safer option.
**Implementing Modal for Expenses**

The user wants a modal to show existing expense types and allow adding and deleting them. I can create a consistent modal named `expenseTypesModal` using existing CSS styles. This will require adding functions in tableUI.js: `openExpenseTypesModal()`, `renderExpenseTypesList()`, and functions for adding and deleting expense types. Currently, categories are stored in an array, so deleting by value is fine. I also need to change the button action from `addExpenseType()` to `openExpenseTypesModal()`. Lastly, it looks like the month functionality is incomplete, requiring handlers for adding and deleting months.
**Adding Month Functionality**

I need to add some functions for managing month tabs. I'll create `addMonth()` to add a new month tab and initialize storage, and `deleteMonth(month)` to remove the data keys and re-render the tabs while adjusting the currentMonth if necessary. The `addMonthBtn` will also need an event listener. When adding a month, it should prompt for the format YYYY-MM and set the currentMonth. Deleting a month should involve cleaning up related data and updating the UI. Overall, I want to ensure these changes don’t disrupt the existing UI design.
**Implementing Month Management**

I'm planning to add functionality for the month management after the `addProjectModal`. I'll create handlers for the `addMonthBtn` and define the `deleteMonth` function since it's referenced but not implemented yet. The `initializeMonthTabs` will need an update to properly handle these changes. Additionally, we should ensure the month selection reflects the last 12 months accurately. I’ll maintain a dynamic array of months in localStorage, updating it whenever months are added or removed for better organization.
**Streamlining Month and Expense Management**

For the `addMonth` function, I’ll set `window.currentMonth` to the entered month and call `initializeMonthTabs`. This way, if the month is within the last 12 months, it will re-render; if not, I can adjust logic to always include `currentMonth`. For `deleteMonth`, we should prevent deletion of months not present in the tabs. I’ll also bind `addMonth` in `setupEventListeners` and fix any reliance on `currentMonth` in project loading. The new modal will have an ID of "expenseTypesModal", containing a list, input field, and delete buttons. I'll implement the necessary functions in tableUI.js for managing expense types efficiently.</details></think>

我會先補上缺失的 UI 行為與函式：新增「支出類型管理」Modal、修好「新增月份」與「刪除月份」功能，並調整按鈕行為與事件綁定，同時不改動現有 UI 風格。接著我就直接套用這些編輯並提交。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering code modifications**

I’m going to read the file to insert the correct code in appropriate places without changing the UI aesthetics. The user had mentioned not wanting any alterations to the UI/UX, but they did mention that adding a modal might be okay since it aligns with existing CSS styling. Their request for displaying existing items first and having add and delete buttons suggests a manager UI, so adding a modal seems fitting. Additionally, I need to add an event listener for the "addMonthBtn" button and ensure the function to bind month addition and deletion works after the DOM loads.
**Clarifying month management**

The user expects the implementation to add a new month and create a corresponding tab, while my current setup selects the next month based on the current date and regenerates tabs for the last 12 months, including future months. It seems okay, but the original design focuses on the last 12 months. The "add month" button is likely for custom months. The deletion process we've set clears data rather than removing tabs, which may not align with the user's expectation to delete month tabs. However, conceptually, clearing data makes sense.
**Updating deletion labels**

The UI currently has a "刪除月份" button marked with X, which might lead users to expect the tab to be removed. However, since the design always reflects the last 12 months, it doesn't quite fit to remove a tab. Maybe I can change the label to "清除這個月份數據," but since the user stated not to change the UI, we'll just clarify that it's about clearing data. I need to safely patch js/tableUI.js by reviewing the file to identify which sections need updates and get the necessary line numbers.</details></think>

- 我已修好你提到的錯誤與功能異常：
  - 修正 app.js 錯誤處理：不再列印 null，顯示具體訊息。
  - 修正專案表單欄位 name，避免 `trim()` 讀到 null。
  - 修正「新增月份」不動作與「刪除月份」：可新增下一個月、可清除指定月份資料。
  - 改善月份切換事件處理，不卡在隱式 event。
  - 新增「支出類型管理」Modal：按下「新增支出類型」會顯示所有類型，支援新增與刪除；不改原 UI 風格。

- 你上面 1-4 點需求對應狀態：
  - 1 新增專案再次送出沒反應：已修正，表單欄位 name 與空字串處理補齊。
  - 2 新增支出類型應顯示現有並可新增/刪除：已新增管理介面與操作。
  - 3 新增/刪除月份無效：已實作新增與刪除（刪除為清空該月資料），並修正事件綁定。
  - 4 已整體檢視，並修正全域變數衝突、錯誤處理與事件綁定問題。

- 後續為 Google Sheets 無痛串接：
  - 我會加一個「標準化匯出層」函式，將現有 localStorage 月度資料轉換為表格化結構（Projects/ProjectExpenses/CompanyExpenses/ExpenseCategories），提供 `window.exportForGoogleSheets()` 給你測試與接 API。這不會改 UI 或現有操作。

要我現在加上 `exportForGoogleSheets()` 嗎？我會先建分支再實作，維持 UI 不變。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Working on expense tracking**

I'm considering how to assign IDs, thinking about a UUID-like value, maybe using 'p_' with Date.now and some randomness. But I need it to be stable across runs, so I might just hash the name and month. However, that seems heavy-duty. A simpler approach is to create an ID like 'm'+month.replace('-','')+'_'+index, which will keep its stability as long as the order doesn't change.

For project expenses, I'm flattening the expenseTypes list and focusing on non-zero entries to keep things tidy. I’ll structure monthly expenses and categories similarly, ensuring that everything exports smoothly in JSON or CSV.
**Implementing export functions**

I’m tasked with providing an "Export for Sheets" function without altering the user interface. They prefer keeping it hidden, so it's likely best to expose it only in the console and link it to the existing exportBtn for downloading JSON. The current exportBtn triggers exportData(), so I won’t change that.

Next, I'll create a file named js/export.js and ensure it's included in index.html before app.js for accessibility. Since the expenseTypes variable is local to tableUI, I’ll access it through localStorage. I will also design a helper function to scan localStorage for relevant project keys and parse the JSON accordingly. Clarity in variable names and code style is key!
**Developing export functions**

In the js/export.js file, I'm setting up functions to get all months and expense types. I’ll need to parse expense types and, if that’s not accessible, fall back on default header texts if needed. It’s probably best to stick to the six base categories used earlier as defaults.

I'll also create a project ID using the specified month, index, and name. As for the setup, I’ll build arrays for project rows, project expenses, company expenses, and expense categories. For each month, I’ll read the projects list from localStorage and ensure it’s treated as an array or defaults to an empty one.
**Processing project and expense data**

For each project at index i, I'm generating an ID using a specific format and then pushing a project row that includes details like the project's name, total income, payment, and the createdAt field—though it doesn’t exist in tableUI, so I’ll default it to an empty string.

When working with expenses, I’ll iterate through each category in expenseTypes, grabbing amounts and pushing rows for positive amounts. Additionally, for company expenses, I’ll load monthly expenses and map them to readable category labels, using a predefined mapping object for clear labeling. Finally, I’ll set up the export function for Google Sheets.
**Finalizing the export process**

I'll return the organized objects for projects, project expenses, company expenses, and expense categories. Additionally, I'll provide a helper function called window.downloadSheetsJSON that allows users to stringify and download data as a JSON file named 'sheets_export_YYYYMMDD.json'. Even though they didn’t explicitly request this feature, I’ll keep the function optional to maintain the existing UI.

Next, I’ll implement the code, ensuring the script tag is included in index.html after js/tableUI.js to maintain order, although it’s not critical since this function only relies on localStorage. I’ll keep the code clean and descriptive, without heavy comments. Let’s move forward with this!</details></think>

---

我會新增一個匯出模組，提供 window.exportForGoogleSheets()，將現有 localStorage 資料轉成 Project/ProjectExpenses/CompanyExpenses/ExpenseCategories 四個表格結構，不改 UI，並在 index.html 掛載新腳本。接著我會提交這批變更。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating project expenses**

I’m considering how to manage project IDs and ensure we maintain existing structures while adding an 'id' field for each project. That seems acceptable since it won't change the UI. For monthly expenses, categories like tax and charity fall under company expenses, yet there’s no separate list for CompanyExpenses in tableUI. I plan to normalize the monthlyExpenses into a list with category mapping and amounts, while project expenses are aggregated per category, producing rows only for amounts greater than zero.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Exploring Google Sheets workarounds**

I’m figuring out that Google Sheets doesn’t support push webhooks directly for sheet changes. So, I’m looking at workarounds like using an Apps Script Web App to host endpoints for reading and writing, and considering the onEdit trigger, though it can’t call external endpoints automatically. 

The Google Realtime API is deprecated, but I might implement doGet and doPost endpoints in Apps Script while utilizing polling for updates. A sync controller to manage localStorage changes and update Sheets could also work!
**Planning near real-time updates**

So, the user wants "兩端時時更新", which means we can propose a "near real-time" solution with a 2-5 second polling interval because there’s no push webhook option. I should consider using Apps Script with a Web App setting shared as "Anyone with link" to manage OAuth requirements.

The plan includes creating endpoints for syncing changes since a timestamp with minimal JSON payloads. I need to focus on implementing `exportForGoogleSheets` first, but since live sync is a priority, I’ll propose a step plan for creating `js/sync.js` to connect with the Apps Script endpoint.
**Defining sync functions**

I need to provide some functions for syncing. First, we want to set up `sync.init` with parameters like endpoint, apiKey, sheetId, and userId. Then, for `sync.pushLocalChanges`, I’m thinking of reading localStorage keys like `projects_<month>`, `monthlyExpenses_<month>`, and `expenseTypes`.

We’ll compute changes based on lastSync, but I’ll need to track updatedAt timestamps. To minimize UI impact, I can intercept the original save functions, possibly creating a SyncManager to handle queuing without disrupting the UI. I’ll add `js/sync.js` before loading app.js to ensure proper order.
**Implementing sync.js**

I’m planning to add the sync.js script right after charts.js, ensuring the UI stays intact because adding script tags won't disrupt it. In sync.js, I’ll implement several key features.

First, I’ll create a config object with a placeholder for `SYNC_ENDPOINT`. Then there's the `queuePush` function, which will debounce posts of the monthly snapshot to the endpoint. I’ll also set up `periodicPull` to fetch the latest data and compare versions.

Finally, I’ll provide a function for exporting data to Google Sheets and create a no-op if the endpoint isn’t set. I’ll need to set up a global config variable in index.html or define it in sync.js.
**Implementing sync and export functions**

I’m planning to keep changes minimal, especially regarding the linter. I can hook into existing functions in `js/tableUI.js` to call `window.syncManager?.onLocalChange()` during saves.

For month changes, periodicPull should use `window.currentMonth`. I need to implement an initial sync on login by calling `window.syncManager?.start()` in `initializeAppAfterLogin`.

In `js/sync.js`, I'll set up a SyncManager to handle push/pull fetching. I'll add a script tag after `charts.js` but before `app.js`, then enhance `tableUI.js` to integrate these sync hooks.

Next, I'll define standardized export tables in my export function for Google Sheets and manage expense categories, projects, and expenses accordingly. The syncing logic will track `lastUpdated` timestamps without impacting the UI. Let's get started!</details></think>

---

我會新增一個 js/sync.js，實作 SyncManager：提供 exportForGoogleSheets()、背景輪詢 pull 與在存檔時 push 的邏輯（可配置 Apps Script Web App endpoint），不改 UI；並在 index.html 掛載該檔；同時在現有存檔/初始化/月份切換點位加入極少量 hook。接著我就直接套用這些編輯並提交。
